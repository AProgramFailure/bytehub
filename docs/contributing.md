# Contributing

There are two main ways to contribute to this project: making a pull request and sending us your notes.

In both of these ways you get credits at the bottom of your notes and a personal "thank you".

## Option 1: (Intermediate)
Talk to us on  discord. Such that I can invite you to be a contributor on the project. :muscle:

## Option 2: (EZ)
Send me a <a href="mailto:m.a.bruderervanblerk@student.utwente.nl?subject=ByteHub%20Notes">email</a> with your notes.
