# Sets

sets are the basic building blocks of mathematics.

### Definition:

*A set is a well defined unordered collection of distinct elements.*

### Examples:

+ `{1, 3, 6}`
a set of numbers

+ `{Jan, Pier, Tjoris, Corneel}`
a set of guys with beards

+ `{{1, 3, 6}, {Jan, Pier, Tjoris, Corneel}}`
a nested set

+ `{1, 2, 3, ...}`
a infinite set

---

+ `{1, 3, 6, 6} = {1, 3, 6}`
**distinct property**

+ `{1, 3, 6} = {1, 6, 3}`
**Unordered property**

+ collection of good soccer clubs != set **not well defined**

### Notation:

+ List of all elements:  
`{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}`

+ Pattern:  
`{1, 2, ... , 9}`

+ Properties:  
`{ n | n is whole number with 1 <= n <= 9 }`

## Set Relations

sets consist of elements.
being an element or not relates an object to a set.

+ 1 is an element of the set `{1, 3, 6}`
    + 1 E `{1, 3, 6}`
    + 1 is in `{1, 3, 6}`

+ 2 is **not** an element of the set `{1, 3, 6}`
    + 2 !E `{1, 3, 6}`


Subsets:

+ `{1, 3}` is a subset of `{1, 3, 6}`
    + `{1, 3}` U= `{1, 3, 6}`

+ `{1, 3}` is a proper subset of `{1, 3, 6}`
    + {1}
