+ Henry Ford -> Model T ford
make a car affordable

Ford assembly line

+ Robotisation

value in waste

* first industrial revolution

spinning jenny invention
textile industry
`+ output - cost`

steam engine (james watt)

labour division (adam smith)
specialization of workers increases productivity

Interchangable parts honore blanc, eli Whitney
standardization of parts increases quality, production speed, efficient repairing

* second industrial revolution

electrification ac - dc wars

scietific managment(taylorism)
following adam smith / charles babbage

best working practives
time and motion studies
differential peice rate system

henry Gantt: gant chart
Gilbreth: Time and motion studies

Diversification

Economies of scale (reduce costs, improve efficency) => Economies of scope (two or more priducts) reduce risk

market pull
economic dev

tech push
automation
manufacturing planning and control
new technologies (3d printing)

### Operations reasearch and operations managment

second world war: logistics problems


### System dynamics

bullwhip effect

products that are diverse in quality makes it slower

stable production process with as little variation as possible is desirable

## Re-discovering manufacturing

closed loop supply chains consist of the primary supply chain and secondary supply loops for the whole product, its componets or its materials

## Changing design paradigms

cradle to grave => cradle to cradle

product returns represent a value stream not just a waste stream

## Netherlands

gateway to europe

+ geografical position
+ rotterdam depth
+ exellent main ports
+ network of hinterland connections
+ logistic service providers networks
+ legislative framework and customs
+ established knowledge centers

Logistics / transport related GDP:
42 billinon E +- 7.5% of GDP

## Urban Distribution
orders online
same day or next orders

cities want to restrict freight truck traffic

## The golden age of service

+ from products to service
+ (spare parts, repairs) great source of revenues and profit
+ aftermarkets 5x > OEM B
+ high margins 24% of business revenues generates 45% of gross profits


## Sercice Managment

## Healthcare

- waiting time
- costs
- waste
- overtime
- cancellations
- space

optimize process

- quality of care
- quality of labor
- productivity

CHOIR example:

help care providers
IT solutions / consulting

reduce wait time
