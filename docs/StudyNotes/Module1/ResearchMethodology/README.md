# Research Methodology


*general toolset for problem solving*
can be used on different domains

study evaluation and design methods and techniques to systematically and transparently
take on the journey to move from a problem or challenge in practive and or theory to an evidence based
solution or answer.

**do not overcomplicate.**

### BIT examples:
+ Business process modelling
	+ Process optimisation
+ Simulation
	+ Emergency response
	+ HR config
	+ Warehousing
+ Business & IT alignment
	+ Organisation IT architecture


know how the process works at this moment
+ desk research
heuristicsinterviews
get input for the optimisation


### Investigative abilities:
+ Investigative attiude
	+ Being critical
	+ Willing to understand
	+ Willing to share
	+ Willing to know
	+ Willing to innovate
+ Being able to apply knowledge from others
+ Being able to do research


### Applied Reasearch
aimed at solving practical problems.
+ Theory and research methods are not being tested.

### Fundamental Reasearch
aimed at generating new (scientific) knowledge
that can be used to solve practical problems.
+ Theory and research methods are being tested.

### Research in practice
i.e organizational research

## Researcher Role:
+ Methodologically Sound
+ Practical Relevance

### at University:
1. BA : Stakeholder
2. MA : Field of Research
3. Ph.D. : Society and science

### Research types
+ Induction: Knowing, Generalisability, new Knowledge
+ Deduction: Enhance, Contextualised usable knowledge

Example:


| Description | Action Problem | Knowledge Problem |

Problem --> Diagnose --> Plan --> Implement --> Evaluate
```

Problem Identification research, Diagnostic research
Design research, Monitoring research, Evaluate research

## Steps

1. Introduction
	+ Justification
	+ Context: problem cluster
	+ Problem or challenge: Problem statement

2. Theory:
	+ Problem cause or challenge requirement 1
	+ Problem cause or challenge requirement 2
	+ Related work / state of the art
	+ Research questions / requirements

3. Research Method:
	+ Problem or challenge 1
	+ Problem or challenge 2

4. Results
	+ Problem or challenge 1
	+ Problem or challenge 2

5. Conclusion & Discussion
	+ Problem or challenge 1
	+ Problem or challenge 2
	+ Main Problem

6. Conclusion/ Discussion

7. Recomendations
	+ Main findings
	+ Practical implications
	+ scientific implication
