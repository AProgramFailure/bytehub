# 3-2 How Bond Prices Vary with Interest Rates
When interest rates change -> bond prices do so as well. The higher interest rate, the lower the price. The yield to maturity which is the interest rate on a bond, is defined as the discount rate that explains the bond price. So when the interest rate(yield to maturity) rises, the bond prices must fall.

+ When the annual yield is equal to the bond's annual coupon rate -> the bond sells for exactly its face value.
+ When the yield is higher than the coupon rate -> the bond sells at a discount to face value.
+ When the yield is lower than the coupon rate -> the bond sells at a premium to face value.

Because of this, bond investors pray that market interest rates will fall so that the price of their securities(bonds) will rise. When the investors are unlucky, the interest rates jump up causing the value of their securities to drop.


## ‚è∞ Duration and Volatility
The price of a long-term bond is affected more by changing interest rates than the price of short-term bonds.
