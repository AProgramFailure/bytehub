# 1-2 The Financial Goal of the Corporation

## ðŸ’» Managers for shareholders
Some corporations have hundreds of thousands of shareholders. All these people can not manage the corporation. Therefore professional managers are granted the authority to do so. All these managers and shareholders have a common objective -> *maximize the current market value of shareholders*. The increased wealth can then be put towards whatever the wish of the shareholders is.

Task of financial manager = **increase market value**

## ðŸŽ¯ A Fundamental Result
Financial managers should act in the will of the shareholders
1. Each stockholder wants three things :
    + To be as **rich** as possible.
    + To transform the wealth into the most desirable **timing of usage**. Either by borrowing more to spend now or invest to spend later.
    + To manage the **risk characteristics** of that usage plan.
2. Stockholders don't utilize the financial managers to obtain the best timing of usage of their wealth. They can also choose the amount of risk of their total investment by investing more- or less-risky securities.
3. There is only one way for financial managers to help the firm's stockholders -> **increasing their wealth**. (by increasing the value of the firm and therefore the price of the shares).
