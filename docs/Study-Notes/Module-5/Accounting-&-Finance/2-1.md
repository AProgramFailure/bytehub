# 2-1 Future Values and Present Values

## ðŸ”® Calculating Future Values
+ 100$ in bank
+ interest rate: 7%
+ `Future value = 100$ x (1 + interest rate) ^ years`

The first year your investment of 100$ grows to 107\$. The second year you earn interest over the original 100$. but also over the $7 you made last year.

**compound rate** = the rate at which your wealth grows

**compound interest** = the interest that you earn

The compound rate will influence exponentially how big your compound interest will be in the future.

## ðŸ“† Calculating Present Values
If you want to know how much you should invest *today* to produce a certain amount at the end of a year. You can run the future calculation in reverse:

`Present value = PV = future value / (discount rate) ^ amount of years`

**discount factor** = present value of one dollar received in year t -> `DF = 1 / ( 1 + discount rate ) ^ t`

As the $ is going to decrease in value by lets say 7% a year and the compound rate of your investment the present value can be calculated like below:

`present value = DF x C = 0.8734 x 144,49 = $100`

## ðŸ”¢ Valuing an Investment Opportunity
When valuing an investment opportunity you will have to make it interesting for the shareholders. Let's say building a new building will cost the company $700.000 and it is known that they can sell it one year later for $800.000. So the expected profit is going to be $800.000 - $700.000 = $100.000. 

The shareholders can invest on their own in other financial markets and make a profit of 7% by investing in safe assets. The new office building is going to get a return of 14%, which is safe as well. The project will therefore get a "go" form the shareholders.

## Net Present Value
**NPV = net present value**

`NPV = PV - investment = 747,664 - 700,00 = $47,664`

## Risk and Present Value
*A safe dollar is worth more than a risky dollar*. Most investors don't like risky investment, unless they prospect a higher return. Not all investments are equally risky. The building development is more risky than a government security but less risky than a startup. 

## Present Values and Rates of Return
`return = profit / investment = (800.000 - 700.000) / 700,000 = 14,3%`

**cost of capital** = the return that is missed out on by **not** investing in financial markets

+ **net present value rule** = accept investments that have positive net present values
+ **rate of return rule** = accept investments that offer rates of return in excess of their opportunity costs of capital

## Calculating Present Values When There Are Multiple Cash Flows
The present value of cash flow (A + B) = present value of cash flow A + present value of cash flow B.

This formula can be used to find the net present value (NPV). `NPV = PV - investment`
