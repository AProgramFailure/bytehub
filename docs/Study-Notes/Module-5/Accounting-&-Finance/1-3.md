## 🧮 How to calculate the rate of return
The rate of return is calculated from the cash inflows and outflows generated by the project. See chapter 2 for more information!

## Is a higher rate of return on investment always better?
Not always, due to two reasons:
+ First, a lower-but-safer return can be better than a higher-but-riskier return.
+ Second, an investment with a higher percentage return can generate less value than a lower-return investment that is larger or lasts longer.

#### In chapter 2 you will be able to see how to calculate the **Present Value** or **(PV)**!!
Present value is a **workhorse concept** of corporate finance that shows up in almost every chapter.

## 💹 What determines value in financial markets?


+ Sometimes the financial manager may be lucky, and may find an almost identical
asset whose value is already known.

## ⏳ What are the cash flows?
The future cash flows from an investment project should be the sum of all cash inflows and outflows caused by the decision to invest.


Cash flows are calculated after corporate taxes are paid.


They are the free cash flows that can be paid out toshareholders or reinvested on their behalf.

## 🔮 How does the financial manager judge whether cash-flow forecasts are realistic?
As observed  by Niels Bohr, the 1922 Nobel Laureate in Physics:

“**Prediction is difficult**, especially
if it’s about the future.” But good financial managers take care to assemble **relevant information**
and to **purge** forecasts of **bias and thoughtless optimism**.

## ⚠️ How do we measure risk?
We look to the **risks borne by shareholders**, recognizing that
investors can **dilute or eliminate** some risks by **holding diversified portfolios**

## 📉 How does risk affect the opportunity cost of capital?
Here we need a theory of risk and
return in financial markets. The most widely used theory is the Capital Asset Pricing
Model

## 💰❓ Where does financing come from?
Broadly speaking, from borrowing or from cash
invested or reinvested by stockholders. But financing can get complicated when you get
down to specifics.
