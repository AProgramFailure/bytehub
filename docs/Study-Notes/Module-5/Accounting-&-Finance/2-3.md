# More Shortcuts â€” Growing Perpetuities and Annuities

## Growing Perpetuities

#### Value-ing value a stream of cash flows that grows at a constant rate
+ The formula for calculating the vaule is, in pracite the sum of a geometric series
    + Forluma looks like this:
    + $ PV of perpetuity = C/(r-g) $
        + where r = return rate
        + where g = growth rate

## Growing Annuities
+ The formula for calculating

+ r = return rate
+ g = growth rate
+ t = years caluclated (**Note**: the number of years is always 1 less than the value of t,)
    + for example **t = 30** , means we calculate for **29** years **not** 30
