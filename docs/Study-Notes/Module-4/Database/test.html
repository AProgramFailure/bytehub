<h3 id="n-ary-associations">N-ary associations</h3>
<p>::: theorem N-ary associations A n-ary association indicates that three (or more) objects are associated with each other.</p>
<p>The association is meaningless if one of the objects is missing. :::</p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="startuml">@startuml</span> &lt;&gt; diamond Class1 “m..n” - “name” diamond diamond - “k..l” Class2 diamond – “i..j” Class3 <span class="citation" data-cites="enduml">@enduml</span></p>
<p>How to understand the multiplicity of Class3: <em>If two objects which are instantiations of classes 1 and 2 are associated with each other, the pair of these objects is a associated with i..k objects of class 3.</em></p>
<h4 id="examples">Examples:</h4>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="startuml">@startuml</span> &lt;&gt; diamond Course “1” - “name” diamond diamond - “1..<em>" TimeSlot diamond – "1..</em>” Room <span class="citation" data-cites="enduml">@enduml</span></p>
<ul>
<li>If a room has been allocated for a given time slot, then it is for exactly one course.</li>
<li>If a given course has been scheduled for a given time slot one or more rooms have been allocated</li>
<li>If a given course is associated with a given room, one or more time slots have been allocated for this course for this room.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example with association class :alarm_clock:</strong></p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="startuml">@startuml</span> &lt;&gt; diamond Course “1” - diamond diamond - “1..<em>" TimeSlot diamond – "1..</em>” Room diamond .. RoomAllocation <span class="citation" data-cites="enduml">@enduml</span></p>
<p><strong>The classic marriage example :bride_with_veil:</strong></p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="startuml">@startuml</span> class Marriage { start: Date end: Date } &lt;&gt; diamond Man “1” - “married” diamond diamond - “1” Woman diamond – “1” Marriage <span class="citation" data-cites="enduml">@enduml</span></p>
<ul>
<li>One man can be married to one woman.</li>
<li>The Same Objects of Man and woman cannot remarry.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="composition">Composition</h3>
<p>::: theorem Composition Officially called “composite aggregation”. A <strong>composed object</strong> is an object made out of one or more other objects.</p>
<p>Properties: + An object that takes part in a composition is associated with a single <strong>composed object</strong>(cannot be part of two objects) + If the <strong>composed object</strong> is deleted, its parts also are deleted. :::</p>
<h4 id="notation">Notation:</h4>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="startuml">@startuml</span> Bicycle *– FramePart <span class="citation" data-cites="enduml">@enduml</span></p>
<h3 id="aggregation">Aggregation</h3>
<p>::: theorem Aggregation UML also defines aggregation that can be used to indicate that an object is aggregated from different parts. :::</p>
<h4 id="notation-1">Notation:</h4>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="startuml">@startuml</span> Bicycle o– Wheel <span class="citation" data-cites="enduml">@enduml</span></p>
<p>Composition and Aggregation both indicate that an object is made out of multiple parts. But in an aggregation implies that the parts can exist independently of the <strong>Composite object</strong>.</p>
<p>In the bicycle example :bicyclist: the frame of the bicycle cannot exist without the bicycle. But the wheels can be removed and swapped to another bike.</p>
<p>::: tip in short 1. A “owns” B = Composition : B has no meaning or purpose in the system without A 2. A “uses” B = Aggregation : B exists independently (conceptually) from A :::</p>
<h2 id="extended-generalization">Extended Generalization</h2>
<p>This notation only applies when a superclass has more than one subclass. Thanks to this notation we can model how objects occur in the system.</p>

<p><strong>Covering Example :beers:</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="startuml">@startuml</span> class Bar circle c Bar &lt;|– c c – StudentBar c – BeachBar</p>
<p>note right of Bar Every bar must be a student bar or a beach bar (or <u>both</u> <sup><i>yeaahh!</i></sup>) So we can note this as a covering generalization. end note <span class="citation" data-cites="enduml">@enduml</span></p>
<p><strong>Disjoint Covering Example :mortar_board:</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="startuml">@startuml</span> class Student circle dc Student &lt;|– dc dc – PostGrad dc – UnderGrad</p>
<p>note right of Student Every student is either an undergrad or a graduate student (not both), so we can make this a disjoint covering generalization. end note <span class="citation" data-cites="enduml">@enduml</span></p>
<p><strong>Disjoint Example :large_blue_circle:</strong> <span class="citation" data-cites="startuml">@startuml</span> class Shape circle d Shape &lt;|– d d – Circle d – Square</p>
<p>note right of Shape A shape can exist without being of the type circle or square. A circle cannot also be a square and a square cannot also be a circle. So this is a disjoint generalization. end note <span class="citation" data-cites="enduml">@enduml</span></p>
<p><strong>Not covering and not disjoint Example :books:</strong></p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="startuml">@startuml</span> class UniversityMember circle <em> UniversityMember &lt;|– </em> _ – Staff _ – Student</p>
<p>note right of UniversityMember A uni member is not necessarily a student or staff, they can be a member of a council for example. end note <span class="citation" data-cites="enduml">@enduml</span></p>
<p><strong>Car Example :car:</strong></p>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="startuml">@startuml</span> class MeansOfTransport circle d MeansOfTransport &lt;|– d d – Car d – Bicycle circle cd Car &lt;|– cd cd – PrivateCar cd – CompanyCar circle cd_ CompanyCar &lt;|– cd_ cd_ – CarLeasedByCompany cd_ – CarOwnedByCompany</p>
<p>note right of MeansOfTransport A car cannot be a bike and vice versa. A means of transport does not have to be a car or bike. end note note left of Car A car has to be either a company car or a private car. a private car cannot be a company car by definition. end note note right of CompanyCar A company car has to be either leased by the company or owned by the company. These classes have no overlap by definition. end note <span class="citation" data-cites="enduml">@enduml</span></p>
