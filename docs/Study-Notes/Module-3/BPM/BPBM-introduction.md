# Introduction to Business Process Management

To understand businesses and organise business activities in a meaningful way need to understand the underlying processes, we do this by looking at Business processes and modeling them.
Business Intellegence (**BI**) is used to do things better based on an understanding of the business. **BI** acquires information on the operation of a company to support decision making.

## Business process

A business process (**BP**) is a set of activities performed in a certain order to realize a buiness goal (it describes how a company operates).

::: tip BP properties

- roles (responsibilities)
- inputs which are the resources required for a process activity
- outputs are results of process activities
- pre/post-conditions which are true statements before and after a process activity is implemented.
  :::

A **BP** may involve one or multiple departments or different organisations but may also interact with other organisations BPs. A BP might be part of the industry value chain which creates value for customers but we restrict a BP to (part of) a single business organization

## Business process management
Business processes are organizational assets that determine the effectiveness and efficiency of organizations. Business processes are intangible, difficult to recognize and observe. We can translate business process to explicit representations, so called **business process models** of which two kinds exits:
- Business process diagrams (we mostly look at this one)
- Linear text models
